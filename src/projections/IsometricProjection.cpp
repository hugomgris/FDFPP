 * @brief Implements the IsometricProjection class for isometric 3D to 2D projection.
 *
 * Isometric projection maintains equal scaling along all three axes and provides
 * a classic 3D visualization commonly used in technical drawings and game graphics.
 * The projection uses a 30-degree angle to create the characteristic diamond-shaped view.

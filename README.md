## Aknowledgements
This project ows a lot to my beloved 42 partner Nico (/mrlouf), who did a very good FDF project which I used as reference to build my C++ version.

You can check out his work at https://github.com/mrlouf/fdf

Thanks, Nico <3

-------------------------------

It also is inspired by the work @ailopez-o did for their FDF project at 42. 

You can check their repo at https://github.com/ailopez-o/42Barcelona-FdF (some of the maps included in my repo are taken from there, so thanks for that too!)
